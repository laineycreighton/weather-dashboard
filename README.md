# Weather Dashboard

<br>

## Description

This project was created to practice using APIs in an application. The Open Weather API was used to pull a five day forecast report for a specified city. This project taught me a lot about how to get an API key and use it based on the specific information I need to access. I found this project to be enjoyable and I feel like working with APIs are pretty fun. It is very interesting how much data can be accessed without researching it manually. I find APIs to be extremely convenient and the documentation for the Open Weather API was fairly simple to follow along.
